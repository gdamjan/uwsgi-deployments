The setup assumes nextcloud is installed in `/usr/share/webapps/nextcloud`.

Configuration is in /etc/nextcloud (pending the `NEXTCLOUD_CONFIG_DIR` merge in
[PR#660](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/660)).

Data would be in `/var/lib/nextcloud` or a subdirectory - you configure that on install.
